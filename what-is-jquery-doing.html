      *  To use jquery we are just calling a function.  It is a regular function call, no magic.  Jquery just happend to name
      * their function "$" 
      * $() 
      */

      // Here we could make an alias to the jquery function if we wanted.  Basically this is just renaming it to "jquery" so instead of using $() we could use jquery().
      let jquery = $

      // We can prove that "$" is just a function by console logging it
      console.log("What the heck is '$' ?!?!?! ")

      console.log("--------")

      */
      
      /** Look at this in the console. The vanilla javascript way of grabbing 
      * an element with getElementById() returns an element. We do not have access to jquery methods because it is just a DOM element. 
      * All we have access to are vanilla javascript 
      * properties and methods, like getElementById("test-element").innerText = "New Text"
      */ 
      console.log('VANILLA JAVASCRIPT TEST ELEMENT: \n', document.getElementById('test-element'))
      console.log("--------")


      /** With Jquery it uses the vanilla javascript getElementById() under the hood,
      * but it puts the returned element into its own jquery object. 
      * Now we are able to access all the methods and properties that jquery offers us to use on the jquery element. Look at the console for the example below, expand the object 
      * and then expand "__proto__".  It is not important to know exactly what __proto__ is yet, but just know that everything you see listed there 
      * are methods that are now attached to the element that we just grabbed with jquery.  For example, each(), val(), attr() etc.

      // Look at this in the console and notice that our jquery object holds an 
      // array of all the elements that we just grabbed
      console.log('SOME BLOCK: \n', blocks)


      /** Because we have an array of jquery elements we can use jquery's looping method
      * which is named .each(). The method each() has multiple ways to be used so take a look at the documentation
      * if you see somebody else using something different and you dont know why.  Each way of using "each()" is basically 
      * the same with some minor differences. But each() takes a function as a parameter.  
      */
    

      /** #1 The Jquery "this" can get confusing.  The most common mistake is thinking that
      * $(this) and vanilla javascript "this" are the same. We will use jquerys each() below to look at "this"
